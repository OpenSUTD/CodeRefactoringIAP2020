# Code Refactoring IAP 2020

This repository contains (will contain) code for Advent of Code 2019, as part of the Code Refactoring 2020 IAP (Independent Activity Period) programme at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.

The course aims to teach participants how to write readable, understandable and modifiable code, based on concepts like DRY, SRP and TDD.

The course will use questions from the Advent of Code 2019 as practise questions.
